tuto pour la memoire

the computer finds room for everything --> int = 4bytes etc..

the adress got an hexadecimal location,
def pointer: a variable that store the adress of something 
new syntax:
	& = adress of the operator 
	* the dereference operator -> get the value
	int *p = &n
	printf('%p', p), give the adress of n --> with hexaD value
We use %p to print the pointer 
adresses changes every time you run the code.
Pointers are 64bites


so in the memory slot of the computer, the value of p is the adress of n;
and the pointers also have his own adress,
