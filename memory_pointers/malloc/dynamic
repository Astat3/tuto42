Dynamic memory allocation / library <stdlib.h>


our programm is stock in the ram memory:
	variable has memory adress,
	block unused 

stack Vs Heap 
	stack 
		regular variable/function, using it without paying attention
		other functions, 
		when a function is not needed, the memory is delocated 
		all data has a fixed sized that does not change
			contrast to the heap
	
	heap 
		dynamic memory allocation
		resize block while the programm is running
		not delocated
		block are not in order as they would be on a stack 
		we can contol how we free space 
		heap using malloc / calloc 
		malloc 
			allocates the number_of_bytes worth of space on the heap
			return a void pointer
				Ex:  creating dynamic array
			int *a = malloc(n),	
				n the number of bytes allocated in the heap 
				return a memory adress hold by a 
			when we done, we have to free the data  using free(a)
			the heap could become full and occurs memory leak
